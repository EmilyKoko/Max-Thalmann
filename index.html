            <p id="landingInfo">Max Thalmann was a German artist and designer known for his expressionist woodcuts.
                Outside of Germany, a large collection of his work was held by his brother, who had emigrated to
                America. This collection has been preserved in Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University and UCLA, the
                former of which is documented on this website. All images on this site are from LMU's Thalmann collection.</p>
